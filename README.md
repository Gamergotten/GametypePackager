# GametypePackager
basic tool for converting between the .bin &amp; .mglo gametype formats
main purpose is for unpacking bin files and sending them to the hotswap folder, so you can utilize that new feature 


(hotswap directory should look like: `C:\Users\[USER]\AppData\LocalLow\MCC\Temporary\HaloReach\HotReload`)

if that folder is not there (`\HotReload`) you will have to manually add it


be careful when using this as it can potentially overwrite your bin files, a warning has been put in place for overwriting .bin's with .mglo's, but i wouldn't rely on that to prevent you from accidently overwriting files
